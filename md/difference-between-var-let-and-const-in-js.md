# Difference between var, let and const in JS #

What are the differences between _var_, _let_ and _const_ in JS?

A _let_ variable is block scoped and can be re-assigned.

A _const_ is block scoped and its reference canâ€™t be re-assigned.

A _var_ can be locally or globally scoped, re-assigned and hoisted.

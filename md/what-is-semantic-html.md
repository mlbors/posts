# What is Semantic HTML? #

Through this article we are going to take a look at what _Semantic HTML_ is and why we should use it.

## Introduction ##

Nowadays, many of us have used _HTML_, either because we are in web/software development or just for fun. Using _HTML_ is one thing and it can seem pretty easy. Effectively, we can quickly get something by just playing around with _HTML_. But using correctly this _markup language_ can be a little bit harder than it seems.

## What is semantics? ##

_Semantics_ is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning. In simple words, it is the study of the relationship between words and their meanings. There are two main domains: one that is concerned with matters such as sense and reference and presupposition and implication, and a second one that is concerned with the analysis of word meanings and relations between them.

## What is the relationship with HTML? ##

_Semantic HTML_ introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. It aims to be semantic and representational: people can know what elements they are looking at and the browsers know how to display them. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

## Why use it? ##

So, why should we care about _Semantic HTML_? By keeping in mind that the _HTML tags_ that we use should describe the underlying meaning of our content, we add additional information about our document and improve our communication.

Using _Semantic Tags_ gives the tools the to browsers and the different search engines to understand our document. So, we get a more searchable content that, obviously, leads to a better search engine ranking. We also increase accessibility for devices such as screen readers that can interpret more easily the meaning of our content. So, browsers, search engines or devices can understand the structure of our document and the roles of the elements inside of it.

Using _Semantic Tags_ can also give us more hooks for styling our content.

We can think that this concept was introduced by _HTML5_, but it is not the case. Many _Semantic Tags_ existed before _HTML5_, but this last one introduced new elements.

## Example ##
Knowing what we know, let's make a very simple example.

    <body>
    
        <header>
            <h1>Welcome on our homepage</h1>
            <p>This is our slogan</p>
        </header>
        
        <nav>
            <header>
            <h2>Take a look at our menu</h2>
            </header>
            <ul>
            <li>Menu 1</li>
            <li>Menu 2</li>
            <li>Menu 3</li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        
        <article>
            <header>
            <h1>This is an article</h1>
            <h2>And its subtitle</h2>
            </header>
            
            <section>
            <h3>First Part</h3>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
            
            <h4>Subsection</h4>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
            <h3>Second part</h3>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
            </section>
        
            <footer>
            <h4>Footer title</h4>
            <p>Paragraph</p>
            </footer>
        
        </article>
        
        <aside>
            
            <h2>This is a sidebar</h2>
            
            <section>
            <h3>Last Posts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Post 1</li>
                <li>Post 2</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

        </aside>
        
        <footer>
            <ul>
            <li>Copyright</li>
            <li>Links</li>
            </ul>
        </footer>
    
    </body>

<p>Through this article, we are going to take a look at the meaning of the word "<em>idempotence</em>" in programming.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The term "<em>idempotence</em>" could seem impressive, but in fact, the concept behind this big word is not really difficult to understand. Let's see how it is related to programming.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p><em>Idempotence</em> is a concept borrowed from mathematics. It describes the property of certain operations that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.</p>

<p>A unary operation, or an operation with one operand, is <em>idempotent</em> if, whenever it is applied twice or more to any value, it returns the same results as if it were applied once.</p>

<p>A binary operation, an operation with two operands, has an <em>idempotent</em> element if the corresponding given value, when it is assigned to both operands, is returned as a result after the operation.</p>

<p>A binary operation can also be <em>idempotent</em> when it is applied to two equal values and gives that value as a result.</p>

<h2 id="programmingexamples">Programming examples</h2>

<p>We will frequently find such a thing when we look for information about <em>idempotence</em>:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(x)) = f(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see how we can illustrate that. We can imagine the following function:</p>

<pre><code>// f(x)
public function addTen(n)
{
    return n + 10;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's use our function:</p>

<pre><code>echo addTen(10); // Prints: 20
// f(f(x))
echo addTen(addTen(10)); // Prints: 30
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, we get a different result each time we apply the function. So, this is not <em>idempotent</em>.</p>

<p>Now, consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>echo abs(-10); // Prints 10
echo abs(abs(-10)); // Prints 10
echo abs(abs(abs(-10))); // Prints 10
</code></pre>

<p>This is <em>idempotent</em>, because we can apply the function as many times as we want and we always get the same result.</p>

<h2 id="moreexamples">More examples</h2>

<p>We can have other things that are <em>idempotent</em>. For example, looking for a specific customer in a database is <em>idempotent</em>, because the database will not change. Changing the customer's address is also <em>idempotent</em> because the final address will be the same no matter how many times it is submitted. Nevertheless, if the customer places an order, this operation is not <em>idempotent</em> because several invocations will lead to several orders.</p>

<p>Make an <em>HTTP GET request</em> is <em>idempotent</em> because we can execute the same request how many times as we want, the result will remain consistent. However, making an <em>HTTP POST request</em> is not <em>idempotent</em> because it is designed to change the targeted element.</p>

<p>Sorting a list is also <em>idempotent</em>. If we sort the list once, then apply the function one more time, the order of the element won't change.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this article we saw what the words "<em>idempotence</em>" means. We saw that it describes the property of certain operations that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.</p>

<p>Through this article, we are going to overview what <em>Dependency Injection</em> is and how it works.</p>
<p><em>Dependency Injection</em>, also called <em>DI</em>, is a <em>design pattern</em> in which one or more dependencies (<em>services</em>) are injected into a dependent object (<em>client</em>). This pattern allows us to implement a loosely coupled architecture by separating the creation of a client’s dependencies from its own behavior.</p>
<p>We can apply this pattern when we want to remove knowledge of concrete implementations from objects, but also when we want to get a better testable code in isolation using mock objects.</p>
<p>The <em>DI</em> pattern is commonly used to implement the <em>Inversion of Controle Principle</em>, which in a few words, separates the <em>what-to-do</em> part of the <em>when-to-do</em> part. In other words, it is about letting somebody else handles the flow of control. It is based on the <em>Hollywood Principle</em>: “Don’t call us, we’ll call you”.</p>

<h2>Basic examples</h2>
<p>The <em>DI</em> pattern can be implemented in several ways. Let’s take a look at some examples written in <em>PHP</em>.</p>

<h3>Constructor Injection</h3>
<p>Here, we will inject dependencies using a <em>constructor</em>. We can imagine a really simple example like so:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface ITire()
{
    public function spin();
}

interface IEngine()
{
    public function run();
}

class TireImpl1 implements ITire
{
    public function spin()
    {
        echo 'Tire 1 is spinning!';
    }
}

class TireImpl2 implements ITire
{
    public function spin()
    {
        echo 'Tire 2 is spinning!';
    }
}

class EngineImpl1 implements IEngine
{
    public function run()
    {
        echo 'Engine 1 is running!';
    }
}

class EngineImpl2 implements IEngine
{
    public function run()
    {
        echo 'Engine 2 is running!';
    }
}

class Car()
{

    private $engine;
    private $tire;
    
    public function __construct(IEngine $engine, ITire $tire)
    {
        $this-&gt;engine = $engine;
        $this-&gt;tire = $tire;
    }
    
    public function run()
    {
        $this-&gt;engine-&gt;run();
        $this-&gt;tire-&gt;spin();
        echo 'Car is running'.
    }

}

$car = new Car(new EngineImpl1(), new TireImpl1());
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, we see that our <em>Car</em> object is not tightly coupled with its dependencies which are not hard-coded and each class can be used independently. By using interfaces, we can pass any object to the <em>Car’s constructor</em> if this object implements the right interface. Even if the <em>Car</em> class needs an <em>Engine</em> and a <em>Tire</em>, it is not its role to create them. The less <em>Car</em> knows about how work its dependencies, the better it is. We can also see that our <em>Car</em> class can be easily tested because its dependencies can be mocked.</p>
<p><em>Constructor injection</em> is the most common method used for <em>Dependency Injection</em>. The advantages are that the dependencies can’t be changed during the object lifetime and the required dependencies are present when the object gets instantiated.</p>

<h3>Setter Injection</h3>
<p>Another common way to use <em>Dependency Injection</em> is the <em>Setter Injection</em>. To use this method, we can modify our previous example like so:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class Car()
{

    private $engine;
    private $tire;
    
    public function __construct()
    {

    }
    
    public function setEngine(IEngine $engine)
    {
        $this-&gt;engine = engine;
    }
    
    public function setTire(ITire $tire)
    {
        $this-&gt;tire = tire;
    }
    
    public function run()
    {
        $this-&gt;engine-&gt;run();
        $this-&gt;tire-&gt;spin();
        echo 'Car is running'.
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Setter Injection</em> allows us to have optional dependencies with default values, to add new dependencies very easily and to call the <em>setters</em> multiple times if needed.</p>

<h3>Container</h3>

<p>A <em>Dependency Injection Container</em> is an object that handles the instantiation of other objects.</p>
<p>The creation of <em>DIC</em> is another subject that we will not see in this article. By the way, there are many popular <em>DIC</em> like <em>Pimple</em>, <em>Dice</em> or <em>PHP-DI</em>. The <em>Zend Framework</em> and <em>Symfony</em> also provide their own container.</p>
<p>One way to build a container could consist to create a file, like a <em>JSON</em> file, where we would list our different dependencies and their arguments. Then we could create a <em>Container</em> class where will use a <em>Repository</em> object to store instantiated services and a <em>Factory</em> object to create the services that have not been instantiated.</p>

<h2>DI and Autoloading</h2>
<p><em>DI</em> could make us think to <em>Autoloading</em> but they should not be confused. <em>Autoloading</em> ensures that our classes are defined when we reference them. <em>Dependency Injection</em> gives us flexibility over what instance of an object we use. <em>Autoloading</em> knows how to load the classes, where each class is defined and includes the correct file. A <em>DIC</em> knows how to build objects of various types. It doesn’t know about class loading.</p>

<h2>DI and Strategy</h2>
<p><em>DI</em> could also make us think about the <em>Strategy Pattern</em>. These patterns work the same way, but <em>Strategy</em> is used for short-lived dependencies. With <em>DI</em>, it is most unusual that the dependencies of objects change during their lifetime, while this is not uncommon with <em>Strategy</em>. With <em>Strategy</em>, classes are designed so that they can be configured with an algorithm at runtime. With <em>DI</em>, classes get an algorithm injected at runtime.</p>

<h2>Using DI with Java</h2>
<p>If we want to use <em>DI</em> with <em>Java</em>, we can make it without any additional framework. By the way, <em>Spring</em> and <em>Google Guice</em> are two very popular frameworks.</p>
<p>However, we can use <em>annotations</em> to define injection points using <em>CDI</em>, available in <em>Java EE</em>, <em>Google Guice</em>, or <em>Spring</em> like so:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public interface EngineService {
    void getService();
}

public class Impl1EngineService implements EngineService {

    @Override
    public void getService() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Impl1EngineService&quot;);
    }
    
}

// Injection through fields
public class Car {

    @Inject
    @Named(&quot;Impl1EngineService&quot;)
    private EngineService Impl1EngineService;

}

// Injection through constructor
public class Car {

    private EngineService Impl1EngineService;
    
    @Inject
    public Car(@Named(&quot;Impl1EngineService&quot;) EngineService Impl1EngineService) {
        this.Impl1EngineService = Impl1EngineService;
    }

}

// Injection through setter method
public class Car {

    private EngineService Impl1EngineService;
    
    @Inject
    public void setImpl1EngineService(@Named(&quot;Impl1EngineService&quot;) EngineService Impl1EngineService) {
        this.Impl1EngineService = Impl1EngineService;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<h2>A word about Angular</h2>

<p>In <em>Angular</em>, <em>DI</em> is widely used and we can take a moment to dig a little into it.</p>
<p><em>Angular</em> uses its own <em>Dependency Injection</em> framework that basically uses three things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Injector</em>, that exposes APIs</li>
<li><em>The Provider</em>, that tells the injector how to create an instance of a dependency</li>
<li><em>The Dependency</em>, the type of which an object should be created</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Angular</em> has a <em>Hierarchical Dependency Injection</em> system. There is a tree of injectors that parallel an application’s component tree. An application may have multiple injectors. That means we can configure providers at different levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the whole application when <em>bootstrapping</em> it. All <em>sub injectors</em> will see the <em>provider</em> and share the instance associated with. It will always be the same instance.</li>
<li>For a specific <em>component</em> and its <em>sub components</em>. Other <em>components</em> won’t see the <em>provider</em>.</li>
<li>For <em>services</em>. They use one of the <em>injectors</em> from the element that calls the <em>service</em> chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using <em>DI</em> with <em>Angular</em>, we will mainly see the following decorators:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>@Injectable</em>, that marks a class as available to Injector for creation</li>
<li><em>@Inject</em>, which specifies a dependency</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing what we know about <em>DI</em>, we can quickly build something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="typescript">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 

@Injectable() 
   export class engineService {  
   
   getEngine(): string { 
      return &quot;Engine 1&quot;; 
   } 
   
}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { engineService } from './engine.service';  

@Component({ 
   selector: 'app', 
   template: '&lt;div&gt;{{value}}&lt;/div&gt;', 
   providers: [engineService]  
}) 

export class AppComponent { 

   value: string = &quot;&quot;; 
   
   constructor(private _engineService: engineService) { } 
   
   // Our, without TypeScript
   // constructor(@Inject(engineService) private engineService) { }
   
   ngOnInit(): void { 
      this.value = this._engineService.getEngine(); 
   }  
   
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

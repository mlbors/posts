<h1>Restoring with the Memento Pattern</h1>

<p>In this article we are going to take a look at the <em>Memento Pattern</em> and how we can use it. Let's get into it!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <em>Memento Pattern</em> is a <em>Behavioural Pattern</em> that offers a way to restore an object back to its previous state, like an "<em>undo</em>" or a "<em>rollback</em>" operation. Its formal definition is the following one:</p>

<p>"<em>Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.</em>"</p>

<p>One of the most famous examples that illustrates the <em>Memento Pattern</em> is a good old calculator where the last calculation is saved in memory so that we can get back to it and eventually restore it.</p>

<h2 id="thepattern">The Pattern</h2>

<p>The <em>Memento Pattern</em> contains a snapshot of the state of an object in a way that it can be restored later without revealing its implementation. It is useful when we want to provide some sort of "<em>undo</em>" functionality or when using a direct interface to obtain the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation.</p>

<p>The <em>Command Pattern</em> can use <em>Memento</em> to maintain the state required for an "<em>undo</em>" operation.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>The <em>Memento Pattern</em> needs three things:</p>

<h3 id="memento">Memento</h3>

<p>It contains a concrete snapshot of the state of any object. The state can include any number of state variables. The <em>Memento</em> object is like a black box that no one can or should change. </p>

<h3 id="originator">Originator</h3>

<p>It contains the actual state of an external object and knows how to save itself. So it can create a <em>Memento</em> containing a snapshot of its current internal state and it can use the <em>Memento</em> to restore its internal state. However, it doesn't know the history of changes.</p>

<h3 id="caretaker">Caretaker</h3>

<p>It is responsible for keeping the <em>Memento</em> and it must not operate on it. It knows why and when the <em>Originator</em> needs to save and restore itself.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Knowing what we know, let's make a quick example of this pattern. We are going to use <em>PHP</em> for this and we are going to say that we are building a basic text editor.</p>

<p>First, we create the <em>Memento</em>:</p>

<pre><code>class Memento
{

    protected $content;

    public function __construct(string $content)
    {
        $this-&gt;content = $content;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this-&gt;content;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can define our <em>Originator</em>. Here it is going to be our editor.</p>

<pre><code>class Editor

{
    protected $content = '';

    public function type(string $words)
    {
        $this-&gt;content = $this-&gt;content . ' ' . $words;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this-&gt;content;
    }

    public function save()
    {
        return new Memento($this-&gt;content);
    }

    public function restore(Memento $memento)
    {
        $this-&gt;content = $memento-&gt;getContent();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Our <em>Client</em>, or the <em>Caretaker</em>, can be like so:</p>

<pre><code>$editor = new Editor();
$editor-&gt;type('A sentence.');
$editor-&gt;type('Another sentence');

$saved = $editor-&gt;save();

$editor-&gt;type('And another one');

$editor-&gt;restore($saved);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this short post we saw how works the <em>Memento Pattern</em>. We saw this is a <em>Behavioural Pattern</em> and it needs three things: a <em>Memento</em>, an <em>Originator</em> and a <em>Caretaker</em>.</p>

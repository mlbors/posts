<h1 id="chainofresponsibilitypattern">Chain of Responsibility Pattern</h1>

<p>Through this article we are going to take a look at the <em>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</em>. Let's get into!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <em>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</em> is <em>Behavioural Pattern</em> that is defined like so:</p>

<p>"<em>Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.</em>"</p>

<p>A real world example of this pattern would be a king that gives orders to his army. The closest element to react would be the commander, then the officer and then the soldier and those three elements would form a <em>Chain of Responsibility</em>.</p>

<h2 id="thepattern">The Pattern</h2>

<p>In plain words, this pattern helps to build a chain of objects and allows an object to send a request without knowing what object will receive and handle it. The request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object until it finds the suitable handler.</p>

<p>In the <em>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</em>, each receiver contains a reference to another receiver. If one object cannot handle the request, then it passes the same request to the next receiver and so on.</p>

<p><em>Chain of Responsibility</em> can use <em>Command</em> to represent requests as objects and it is also often used with <em>Composite</em>.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>This pattern needs the following things:</p>

<h3 id="handler">Handler</h3>

<p>It defines an interface for handling requests. It can also implement the successor link.</p>

<h3 id="requesthandler">Request Handler</h3>

<p>It handles the requests it is responsible for. If it can handle the request it does so, otherwise it forwards the request to its successor.</p>

<h3 id="client">Client</h3>

<p>It sends commands to the first object in the chain that may handle the command.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Let's make a simple example to illustrate how we can use this pattern. We are going to us <em>PHP</em> for this and we are going to say we are building some kind of service.</p>

<p>First, we define an interface (<em>Handler</em>):</p>

<pre><code>interface Handler
{
    public function handleRequest($request); 
    public function setSuccessor($nextService);        
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can have two concrete implementations (<em>Request Handlers</em>):</p>

<pre><code>class JsonService implements Handler
{

    private $successor;

    public function setSuccessor($nextService)
    {
        $this-&gt;successor = $nextService;
    }

    public function handleRequest($request)
    {
        if ($request-&gt;getService() == "JSON")
        {
            echo ("I am parsing JSON!");
        }
        else if ($this-&gt;successor != NULL)
        {
            $this-&gt;successor-&gt;handleRequest($request);
        }
    }

}

class XMLService implements Handler
{

    private $successor;

    public function setSuccessor($nextService)
    {
        $this-&gt;successor = $nextService;
    }

    public function handleRequest($request)
    {
        if ($request-&gt;getService() == "XML")
        {
            echo ("I am parsing XML");
        }
        else if ($this-&gt;successor != NULL)
        {
            $this-&gt;successor-&gt;handleRequest($request);
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now define some kind of request:</p>

<pre><code>class Request
{

    private $value;

    public function __construct($service)
    {
        $this-&gt;value = $service;
    }

    public function getService()
    {
        return $this-&gt;value;

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And our <em>Client</em> could be like so:</p>

<pre><code>$json = new JsonService();
$xml = new XMLService();

$json-&gt;setSuccessor($xml);

$request = new Request("XML");

$json-&gt;handleRequest($request);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this article, we saw how works the <em>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</em>. We saw that it is a <em>Behavioural Pattern</em> that allows us to build a chain of objects to handle a call in sequential order. To apply this pattern, we need a <em>Handler</em>, a <em>Request Handler</em> and a <em>Client</em>.</p>

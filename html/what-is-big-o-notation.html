<p>This post describes the real basics of Big O notation and doesnâ€™t cover the entire subject. It is just a simple and brief introduction.</p><p>Big O notation is the mathematical notation used to express the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm. </p><p>If you have something like O(1), it describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time, for example, print a specific element of an array. </p><pre><code>public function foo($myArray) {
  echo $myArray[0];
} </code></pre><p>O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set, for example, print all the elements of an array. </p><pre><code>public function foo($myArray) {
  foreach($myArray as $item) {
    echo $item;
  } 
}</code></pre><p>But if there is a loop inside the parent loop, it will be noted O(n^2), because it is a quadratic function. </p><pre><code>public function foo($myArray) {
  foreach($myArray as $item) {
    foreach($item as $subitem) {
      echo $subitem;
    }
  }
} </code></pre><p>These are the real basics of Big O notation and there are more complex things about it. Maybe I will continue in a further post. </p>

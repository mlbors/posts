Simplify everything with the Facade Pattern

In this post, we are going to look at the <i>Facade Pattern</i>.

The <i>Facade Pattern</i> is a <i>structural pattern</i> that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It is like when we turn on our smartphone, we just push one button and we ignore all the operations that have to be done behind.

The goal of the <i>Facade Pattern</i> is to reduce coupling and complexity. However, a <i>Facade</i> doesn't forbid us to access to the subsystem. We can also have multiple <i>Facades</i> for one subsystem. 

A <i>Facade</i> can be useful when we want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem, to layer our subsystems or when there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.

Let's make a quick example of the <i>Facade Pattern</i> using <i>PHP</i>. Let's say we have a spaceship and we want it to take off or land on.

First, we create our <i>SpaceShip class</i>.

<pre><code class="php">class SpaceShip {

    public function getPower() {
        echo "Getting power!";
    }

    public function blink() {
        echo "Blinking lights!";
    }

    public function makeNoise() {
        echo "Beep beep beep!";
    }

    public function leaveTheGround() {
        echo "Leaving the ground!";
    }

    public function getBackOnTheGround() {
        echo "Getting back on the ground.";
    }

    public function turnOffEngine() {
        echo "Turning engine off.";
    }

    public function switchOffTheLights() {
        echo "Switching off the lights!";
    }

}</code></pre>

And now we can create our <i>Facade</i>:

<pre><code class="php">class SpaceShipFacade
{
    protected $spaceShip;

    public function __construct(SpaceShip $spaceShip)
    {
        $this->spaceShip = $spaceShip;
    }

    public function takeOff()
    {
        $this->spaceShip->getPower();
        $this->spaceShip->blink();
        $this->spaceShip->makeNoise();
        $this->spaceShip->leaveTheGround();
    }

    public function landOn()
    {
        $this->spaceShip->getBackOnTheGround();
        $this->spaceShip->turnOffEngine();
        $this->spaceShip->switchOffTheLights();
    }
}</code></pre>

And we can use it like so:

<pre><code class="php">$spaceShip = new SpaceShipFacade(new SpaceShip());
$spaceShip->takeOff();
$spaceShip->landOn();</code></pre>

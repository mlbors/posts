<p>In this article we are going to see how to build a really simple <em>Node.js</em> app and how to deploy it on <em>Heroku</em>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The project we are going to make is very simple. Its goal is to discover how to build a <em>Node.js</em> app quickly and how to deploy this last one on <em>Heroku</em>. It is going to be really straight forward and we are not going to use additional frameworks like <em>Express</em>. Our application is just going to be a timestamp microservice that we are going to be able to reach with something like <em>http://localhost:3000/September%2026,%202017</em> or <em>http://localhost:3000/1506384000</em> and it is going to return a human readable date and a timestamp. </p>

<h2 id="whatisnodejs">What is Node.js?</h2>

<p>If we go on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><em>Node.js</em>'s official website</a>, we can read the following statement:</p>

<p>"<em>Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</em>"</p>

<p>It can be tough to understand. We can simplify it like so: <em>Node.js</em> is an open source server framework that runs on various platforms and allows us to use <em>JavaScript</em> on the server side. This is a basic explanation, but we can get the picture.</p>

<p>So, we are going to use <em>Node.js</em> to build a really simple application that we are going to deploy on <em>Heroku</em>.</p>

<h2 id="whatisheroku">What is Heroku?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/"><em>Heroku</em>'s website</a> says things like so: "<em>Heroku is a platform as a service that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud</em>". In other words, with <em>Heroku</em>, we can simply push our code to a remote repository and everything we need to deploy our application will be run for us. The <em>Heroku</em> platform supports development in <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>Python</em>, <em>Scala</em> and <em>Clojure</em>.</p>

<p>In our small project, we are going to use the <em>Heroku</em> platform to deploy our application.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>To achieve our goal, we need to install a few things. Let's grab <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><em>Node</em> and <em>NPM</em></a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><em>Git</em></a>. We also need an account on <a href="https://github.com/"><em>GitHub</em></a> and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/"><em>Heroku</em></a>. When it is done, we'll have to install <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli"><em>Heroku CLI</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now, let's build our app!</p>

<h2 id="initializingourapp">Initializing our app</h2>

<p>First, let's create a directory. We can then go into that last one. We now have to run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>npm init
</code></pre>

<p><em>Initializing the project</em></p>

<p>A few questions will be asked during the process. Our app is now in place.</p>

<h2 id="pushingitongithub">Pushing it on GitHub</h2>

<p>It is time to create a repository on GitHub. When it is done, in our directory, we can run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin REPOSITORY
git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<p><em>Linking our code to our remote repository</em></p>

<p>Our app is on <em>GitHub</em>. We can move to the next step!</p>

<h2 id="finishingthecode">Finishing the code</h2>

<p>In our file <em>package.json</em>, in the scripts section, let's add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>"start": "node index.js"
</code></pre>

<p><em>Package.json file</em></p>

<p>This line allows us to execute our application with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre>

<p><em>Running our app</em></p>

<p>We are now going to create a file called <em>index.js</em> where we are going to put the following code:</p>

<pre><code>const http = require('http')
const url = require('url')

const service = require('./service')

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {

  if (req.method === 'GET') {

    const path = url.parse(req.url).pathname.slice(1).replace(/%20/g, ' ')

    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'})    
    res.write(JSON.stringify(service(path)));
    res.end();

  }

}).listen(port, hostname, function(){
  console.log('Server running at http://${' + hostname + '}:${' + port + '}/');
})
</code></pre>

<p><em>index.js file</em></p>

<p>With the first two lines, we import two core modules that we are going to use to create our server and to parse our URL. The <em>HTTP module</em> allows <em>Node.js</em> to transfer data over the <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em> while the <em>URL module</em> splits up a web address into readable parts. The next line imports another module that we will talk about later.</p>

<p>The port that we listen to will be the one defined in the <em>environment variables</em> on <em>Heroku</em> or <em>3000</em>.</p>

<p>Then, we create an <em>HTTP server</em> with a request handler function as parameters. We have access to two objects, <em>request</em> (req) and <em>response</em> (res).  </p>

<p>After this, we check the method used for the request, get the <em>pathname</em> attribute from our <em>URL</em> and the set the headers before sending a response body in <em>JSON</em>. Then we just end the response.</p>

<p>With <em>listen</em>, we bind a port and listen for incoming connections. It is important to note that the <em>listen</em> method needs to be called on the <em>server object</em>.</p>

<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the service module. This just another file, called <em>service.js</em>, where we just export one function:</p>

<pre><code>'use strict'

const months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

const isValidDate = date =&gt; {
  return date.getTime() === date.getTime()
} 

const parseTimeStamp = timestamp =&gt; {
  const date = new Date(timestamp)
  return months[date.getMonth()] +  ' ' + date.getDate() + ', ' + date.getFullYear()
}

const fromTs = timestamp =&gt; {
  return {unixtime: timestamp, natural: parseTimeStamp(timestamp*1000)}
}

const fromNatural = date =&gt; {
  const ts = date.getTime()
  return {unixtime: ts/1000, natural: parseTimeStamp(ts)}
}

const prepareDate = str =&gt; {
  let output = {}

  if (typeof str !== 'undefined' &amp;&amp; str !== '' &amp;&amp; str !== null) {

    const input = parseInt(str)

    if (isNaN(input)) {
      const date = new Date(str)

      if (isValidDate(date)) {
        output = fromNatural(date)
      } else {
        output = {error: 'invalid date format'}
      }

    } else {
      const pattern = /\d{10}/g
      const regex = new RegExp(pattern)
      let m
      if ((m = regex.exec(input)) !== null) {
        output = fromTs(input)
      } else {
        output = {error: 'invalid timestamp'}
      }
    }

  }
  return output
}

module.exports = prepareDate
</code></pre>

<p><em>service.js</em></p>

<p>This is not a perfect code neither the cleanest, but it is just for the example. But in the end, it means that we can reach our application with something like <em>http://localhost:3000/September%2026,%202017</em> or <em>http://localhost:3000/1506384000</em> and it is going to return a human readable date and a timestamp.</p>

<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>

<p>We now have to tell <em>Heroku</em> what command to execute to start our app. For that, we need to create a file called <em>Procfile</em> without extension. In this last one, we are simply going to place the following line:</p>

<pre><code>web: node index.js
</code></pre>

<p><em>Procfile file</em></p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

<p>Now, we can deploy our app on <em>Heroku</em>. In our directory, we have to run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>heroku login
heroku create
git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p><em>Pushing our application</em></p>

<p>The application is now deployed. We can ensure that at least one instance of the app is running like so:</p>

<pre><code>heroku ps:scale web=1
</code></pre>

<p><em>Scaling our app</em></p>

<p>We can now visit our app through our <em>Heroku</em> dashboard or with the next command:</p>

<pre><code>heroku open
</code></pre>

<p><em>Opening our app</em></p>

<p>In our dashboard, we can also set an additional option that will link our <em>GitHub</em> repository to Heroku and execute the deployment process every time we push something on our <em>master branch</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this article we saw how to install <em>Node.js</em> and how to initialize a simple application. We used core modules to create a really basic application to get more familiar with <em>Node.js</em>. We also deployed our code on <em>Heroku</em> in a very smooth way with just a few commands. As an aside note, we can say that we did not really use <em>NPM</em>, the package manager for <em>Node.js</em>. We used it just to initialize our app. That's why there's no <em>node</em>modules_ folder in our app directory. We could also do it with <em>Yarn</em> which is pretty close to <em>NPM</em>.</p>

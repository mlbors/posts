<h1 id="preconditionsandpostconditions">Preconditions and Postconditions</h1>

<p>In this article, we are going to talk about the terms "<em>precondition</em>" and "<em>postcondition</em>".</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The words "<em>precondition</em>" and "<em>postcondition</em>" can seem to be frightening words, but they are not so complicated to understand. Let's see what they mean and how they are implied in programming.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>First, let's define, in some kind a formal way, the words "<em>precondition</em>" and "<em>postcondition</em>".</p>

<h3 id="precondition">Precondition</h3>

<p>A <em>precondition</em> is a condition, or a predicate, that must be true before a method runs for it to work. In other words, the method tells clients, "this is what I expect from you". So, the method we are calling is expecting something to be in place before or at the point of the method being called. The operation is not guaranteed to perform as it should unless the <em>precondition</em> has been met.</p>

<h3 id="_postcondition_">Postcondition</h3>

<p>A <em>postcondition</em> is a condition, or a predicate, that can be guaranteed after a method is finished. In other words, the method tells clients, "this is what I promise to do for you". If the operation is correct and the <em>precondition(s)</em> met, then the <em>postcondition</em> is guaranteed to be true.</p>

<h2 id="realworldexamples">Real world examples</h2>

<p>Let's see, in the real world, what could be a <em>precondition</em> and a <em>postcondition</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eating a pizza - <em>precondition</em>: there is a pizza; <em>postcondition</em>: there is no pizza</li>

<li>Withdrawing money from a debit account in ATM - <em>preconditions</em>: the sum being withdrawn should be smaller than or equal to the sum remaining on the account and smaller than the sum remaining in the ATM; <em>postconditions</em>: the reminders of money in both ATM and on the account should equal their original values minus the sum being withdrawn</li>

<li>Mario beating Bowser - <em>precondition</em>: Bowser is here; <em>postcondition</em>: Mario saved Peach</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="amorepragmaticexample">A more pragmatic example</h2>

<p>Now, let's have a more pragmatic example. Let's imagine that we have a function that computes the square root of a number. So the <em>preconditions</em> here are the argument to the square root function must be non-negative and greater than or equal to zero. The <em>postcondition</em> is the square of the computed result must equal the argument. We could express it this way:</p>

<pre><code>def square_root(x):
    assert x &gt;= 0 // _preconditions_

    THE COMPUTATION ITSELF... RETURNS A VALUE NAMED Y

    assert y*y == x // _postcondition_
    return y
</code></pre>

<h2 id="programmingexample">Programming example</h2>

<p>Let's say we have the following piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>int getSum(int a, int b)
{
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function just computes the sum of two given integers and returns it. So, in this case, the <em>preconditions</em> are the two given values are two valid integers. The <em>postcondition</em> is that the sum of those integers is returned and is in fact, an integer.</p>

<h2 id="invariant">Invariant</h2>

<p>We may sometimes hear the word "invariant". An invariant is something that is always true and won't change. The method tells clients, "if this was true before you called me, I promise it'll still be true when I'm done". An invariant is a combined <em>precondition</em> and <em>postcondition</em>. It has to be valid before and after a call to a method.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this article, we saw what "<em>precondition</em>" and "<em>postcondition</em>" mean. We saw that a <em>precondition</em> is a condition that must be true before a method is called while a <em>postcondition</em> is a condition that must be true after the method is complete.</p>
